## Site settings

Edit `site-config.js` in the project root to change the displayed version and enable or disable site features. Bump `version` when publishing a site change so returning visitors see the update banner.

Available feature switches: `updateNotices`, `episodeFilters`, `hostPanel`, `episodeDeletion`, and `backgroundMusic`.

## API routes

EdgeOne maps `cloud-functions/api/episodes.js` to `/api/episodes` and `cloud-functions/api/audio.js` to `/api/audio`. Keep those files in the top-level `cloud-functions/api` directory and include the folder in the deployment source. Redeploy after changing function files.
